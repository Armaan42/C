//Write a program to calculate the electricity bill of a given customer. 
//The unit consumed by the user should be taken from the keyboard, and display the total amount to be paid by the customer. The charges are as follows:

//Unit                                Charge/unit
//Upto 199                            @1.20
//200 and above, but less than 400    @1.50
//400 and above, but less than 600    @1.80
//600 and above 					  @2.00

//If the bill exceeds Rs. 400, then a surcharge of 15% will be charged and the minimum bill should be of Rs. 100.
